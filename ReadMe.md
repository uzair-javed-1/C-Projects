this program just take increment when any vehicle added to the parking , it can store almost 50 vehicle and then display to secreen it is a simple program ,we want to add more functionality like decrement when cars out from the parking area and exception handling to fix errors when different variable type is given to different variable type causes error .. the program stucks and plays a infinite loop so that we want to fix these issues . also we want to store all record on the word file that stores today's record of parking area.
the other problems with this program is that forexample if 2 cars or more come at the same time than how we increment these at the same time and also to decrement , so that we need functions to perform these activities .
this program is another problem forexample it stores 50 vehicles at a time , if we add 50 buses on the parking area we can add , but in the reality the size of the parking area depends that how many cars ,buses , bikes can adjust to this area , so we want to make this program more effective , we will continue working on this project to make this better.
